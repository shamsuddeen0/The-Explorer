# 🛡️ My Cyber Security Journey

Welcome to my personal knowledge base! This repository serves as a documentation of my journey into the world of Cybersecurity.

As I learn new concepts, solve CTFs, and explore tools, I document them here. The goal of this project is not just to store my notes, but to provide a roadmap and resources for others who are starting their journey after me.

## 🚀 Overview
Unlike a static textbook, this is a **living document**. It tracks my progress from the fundamentals to advanced topics. If you are a student, a career switcher, or a tech enthusiast, you can use this repo to see exactly what resources I used to learn specific topics.

**My Goal:** To make cybersecurity accessible by sharing "how I learned it" rather than just "what it is."

## 📂 The Repository Map
Here is how I have organized my learning path. The folders are numbered to guide you through the curriculum logically.

### 📍 [00-Start-Here](00-Start-Here/)
*The roadmap and philosophy.*
- My detailed learning timeline and my standard hacking methodology.

### 🧪 [01-The-Laboratory](01-The-Laboratory/)
*Where I build the infrastructure to practice safely.*
- Guides on setting up **Kali Linux**, **VirtualBox**, **CloudGoat (AWS)**, and **Active Directory**.

### 🧱 [02-Fundamentals](02-Fundamentals/)
*The basics I needed before hacking.*
- **[Linux](02-Fundamentals/Linux/)**: User management, permissions, and Bash scripting.
- **[Networking](02-Fundamentals/Networking/)**: Protocols, subnetting, and common ports.

### 🕵️ [03-Reconnaissance-OSINT](03-Reconnaissance-OSINT/)
*Gathering intel before the attack.*
- **Social Engineering**: Tools like `Sherlock` and `theHarvester`.
- **Asset Discovery**: Finding subdomains and cloud buckets.

### 📡 [04-Scanning-Enumeration](04-Scanning-Enumeration/)
*Touching the target.*
- **[Nmap Cheat Sheet](04-Scanning-Enumeration/Nmap-The-Holy-Grail.md)**: The holy grail of port scanning.
- **[Service Specific](04-Scanning-Enumeration/Service-Specific/)**: How to enumerate SMB, Web, and more.

### ⚔️ [05-Exploitation](05-Exploitation-Red-Team/)
*Getting the shell.*
- Web Hacking (OWASP Top 10), Reverse Shells, and Active Directory attacks.

### 🛡️ [07-Blue-Team-Defense](07-Blue-Team-Defense/)
*Understanding how to stop the attacks.*
- Log analysis, firewalls, and incident response notes.

## 💡 How to Use This Repo
1.  **Clone it**: Keep these notes locally as a reference using `git clone`.
2.  **Follow the Roadmap**: Check `00-Start-Here/My-Roadmap.md` to see the order in which I learned topics.
3.  **Check the Resources**: In every folder, I link the specific videos or articles that helped me understand the concept.

## 🤝 Contributing
I am currently learning, which means **I make mistakes**.
