# 🏁 Start Here: The Philosophy & Plan

**"Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a hacker."**

This directory contains the core documents that guide my entire journey. Before learning specific tools, I defined my goals and my methodology.

## 📄 Contents
1.  **[My-Roadmap.md](My-Roadmap.md)**
    *   A living timeline of what I have learned and what I plan to learn next.
    *   It tracks my progress through Networking, Linux, Offensive Security, and Blue Teaming.

2.  **[Methodology.md](Methodology.md)**
    *   **The most important file in this repo.**
    *   This is the standard checklist I follow for every CTF box or assessment. It ensures I don't "rabbit hole" into complex exploits before checking the basics.

### 🧠 My Mindset
I treat this journey as a marathon, not a sprint.
*   **Documentation:** If I can't write it down simply, I don't understand it yet.
*   **Ethics:** I only test systems I have permission to test.
*   **Curiosity:** I am here to understand how things work, not just how to break them.
